            My philosophy of teaching is to build skills that allow for meaningful communication in the real-world. I believe that knowledge of a concept is only a part of the student's success, and that significant learning occurs when a student shares their learned knowledge with others. That knowledge can be shared with a variety of audiences: people, peers, and professionals. Consequently, I strive to incorporate interactive components into my teaching that have the opportunity to produce constructive feedback.

            In my experience, students are hesitant to learn something when it seemingly does not apply to "the real world." Making sure students know why we are learning something and how it can be applied to life outside of the classroom makes the learning more effective, not simply a means to fulfill a requirement. I believe that the applicability of concepts learned in the classroom should not only apply to the contents of that class.

            Lastly, I believe that students learn best by doing, but to do things right, they need guidance. By extension, learning starts with seeing what the product looks like, working through a guided problem, then working through an unguided problem. This progressive learning style, I believe, not only teaches students how to do a given skill, but also how to extend that skill into further exploration in a topic. Combined with understanding the impact and real-world applications of a topic, it empowers students to learn how to learn.
