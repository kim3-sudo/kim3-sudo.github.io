The idea for Luuply started when a group of Johns Hopkins senior lacrosse players were looking back on the past four years of their lives. A question was posed: “If you could go back in time, knowing what you know now, would you have chosen to play here?” Luuply was created to help high school athletes and their parents make more informed decisions during the recruiting process. What better way to learn about a collegiate athletic program than from those who are or were a part of it? Luuply is the first platform for student-athletes to securely provide feedback about their experiences.

I was contracted by Luuply to coordinate the building of their platform and continue to work with them as their chief technologist. Luuply is built on a highly-modified version of WordPress and runs on custom enterprise cloud infrastructure, which the technology team manages.
