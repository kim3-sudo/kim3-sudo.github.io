This project was contracted by the Department of Water and Wastewater in Mount Vernon, Ohio, US. They had decades worth of consumer data stored in their online system and needed to switch platforms because of financial and usability reasons that hindered their ability to use their existing platform. Their new platform only allowed them to store the previous five years of data, and they needed a read-only system that would allow them to store, search, and view old customer data.

The developers used C++14 as the backend technology, supported by HTML/CSS/JS and jQuery on the frontend. Non-ephemeral storage was handled using MySQL 5.
