            <b>Point of Clarification</b>
        </p>
        <p>By "database," I am specifically referring to a relational database management system, or RDBMS. The most common type of RDBMS is a <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> database. There are other types of databases out there, like NoSQL (Mongo) and flat-file databases, but we are specifically talking about server-client-type RDBMSes.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Platform-Agnosticism</b>
        </p>
        <p>Much of the guidance provided here is <em>platform-agnostic</em>, meaning that it can generalize to all kinds of SQL databases. Specifically, they all comply with the SQL language definition.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that many SQL RDBMSes maintain additional functionality beyond what is specified in the SQL language construct. For example, Oracle SQL features a <code>REGEXP_REPLACE()</code> function that does not exist in other RDBMSes. Your specific flavor of SQL RDBMS may not support the exact functions you need. That means you'll have to achieve that same functionality either programatically in SQL or using an external processor.</p>
