            <b>Development Tools</b>
        </p>
        <p>These are tools that I like using. Be honest with yourself about what you really need. Most people only need one or two development tools to be effective.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Visual Studio Code
                <ul>
                    <li>Publisher: Microsoft Corporation</li>
                    <li>Visual Studio Code starts off as just a text editor, but by adding extensions, it can be quickly turned into a full IDE for your specific environment.</li>
                    <li>Support for tons of languages (with more possible with extensions)</li>
                    <li>Support for Git GUI OOTB</li>
                    <li>Powerful extensions are freely available (though like any software, you should vet the credibility of any extensions you install)</li>
                    <li>Writing Python code? Install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python">Python</a> extension!</li>
                    <li>Working with MySQL or MariaDB databases? Install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.mysql-shell-for-vs-code">MySQL Shell for VS Code</a> extension!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Development Libraries &amp; Frameworks</b>
        </p>
        <p>These are libraries and frameworks that I've used and can suggest you use (if they're right for your use case).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                TinyMCE
                <ul>
                    <li>Need a WYSIWYG editor? Use TinyMCE, a pure JavaScript library, to power a WYSIWYG editor rendered client-side.</li>
                    <li>TinyMCE also handles some of the annoying stuff, like HTML injection. It'll automatically make the tags that are created in the WYSIWYG editor and escape special characters.</li>
                    <li>Cost: Free (OSS) (with paid version)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Bootstrap 5
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap versions matter, and Bootstrap 5 removes the dependency on Jquery. You can still use Jquery, if you need it, though!</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap 5 helps you with more automatic calculations, but still lets you customize things to your needs.</li>
                    <li>Word of warning: don't confuse the documentation and compatible functions between the different major versions of Bootstrap!</li>
                    <li>Cost: Free (OSS)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Electron
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're already familiar with web-side development and you have a need to do some desktop stuff too, Electron is a good way to do that.</li>
                    <li>You may need to familiarize yourself with JavaScript (as a programming language) and Node.</li>
                    <li>Proceed with caution: Electron apps have some notoriety for being memory and storage hogs! (Discord, Spotify, and Slack are Electron or Electron-like apps; take a look at their app sizes!)</li>
                    <li>Cost: Free (OSS)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Monaco
                <ul>
                    <li>The same editor that powers Visual Studio Code</li>
                    <li>Cost: Free (OSS)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
